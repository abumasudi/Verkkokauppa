This project was created for PHP course in Laurea University of Applied Sciences.

The idea of the application is to let people buy stuff from this webshop. 
Users are required to create an account on the website. With accounts, they can add stuff to the shoping cart and database. 
Only members can add stuff to shopping cart from the database.
The website is responsive.
The Paypal payment its not working yet.
